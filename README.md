<h2>Random Snakes:</h2>

 The goal of this program is to create random snake-liked robots. Each snake has a random number of parts (Between 2 and 7) and a random number of sensors (Between 1 and NumParts-1). Sensor links are green, normal links are blue. Each link's length, width, and height are randomly selected (Between 0.25 and 1). Each link is connected by a joint that either moves on the x or z joint axis.
